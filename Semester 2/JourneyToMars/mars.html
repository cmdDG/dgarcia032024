    <h2>About Mars</h2>
    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is often called the Red Planet due to its reddish appearance. It has the tallest volcano and deepest canyon in the solar system.</p>
    <p>Despite being dry and cold, Mars shows signs that liquid water once flowed on its surface. Scientists believe Mars could have once supported life — and may still harbor microbial life underground.</p>
    <p>With its thin atmosphere and harsh conditions, Mars remains one of the most intriguing destinations in our solar system.</p>

    <p>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun. It is much smaller than Earth and has a thin atmosphere that is mostly made of carbon dioxide. The temperatures on Mars are very cold, and there is no liquid water on the surface, but frozen water has been found at the poles.

      Even though Mars seems like a harsh place, scientists think it may have once had rivers and lakes. Some believe that tiny life forms could have lived there long ago. Today, robots like NASA’s rovers explore Mars to study its rocks, soil, and weather. Every discovery helps us understand if humans could one day live there.</p>
